# 🧠 ML_ROADMAP

Your step-by-step guide to building, deploying, and scaling machine learning projects.
Perfect for intelligent applications like chatbots, this roadmap covers MLOps, CI/CD, and team collaboration best practices.

🚀 Getting Started

# Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/Teungtran/ML_ROADMAP.git

cd ML_ROADMAP


# Create and switch to your own branch

git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name


# Stage all changes

git add .

# Commit your changes with a clear message

git commit -m "Add: Description of your feature"

# Push the branch to GitHub

git push -u origin feat/your-feature-name

# 📁 Add or Upload Files

You can add files in three ways:

# 🧱 Use GitHub Interface

Go to the repository on GitHub.

Click "Add file" → "Create new file" or "Upload files".

# 💻 Use the Command Line (for existing repos)

cd existing_repo

# Link your local repo to GitHub

git remote add origin https://github.com/Teungtran/ML_ROADMAP.git

# Rename the branch to main and push

git branch -M main

git push -u origin main

🔧 Tool Integration

# Recommended Tools to Set Up

✅ GitHub Actions – for automation & CI/CD

🔁 Webhooks – for event-driven workflows

🔐 Secrets – for storing credentials securely

📦 ML Tools – such as:

DVC – Data Version Control

MLflow – Experiment tracking

Weights & Biases – Logging and visualization

🤝 Collaborate with Your Team

Invite collaborators via GitHub:

→ Go to Settings → Manage Access

Create Pull Requests (PRs)

Link Issues to PRs for automatic closing

Enable Branch Protections and Code Review Rules

🧪 Test and Deploy

Use GitHub Actions to automate testing and deployment.

Setup Steps:

Create workflows in .github/workflows/

Add jobs for:

✅ Automated testing

✅ Code linting

✅ Security scans (e.g., static analysis)
